Does extraversion predict differences in amygdala activation during long-term memory tasks?

## E. Methods
Having done several power analysis, we were able to idenitfy the correct number of participants needed for our replication. After acquiring the raw data, we cleansed it of off low quality data and ended up with 833 participants. For statistical analysis we used the statictical programm R and for the correlations we used the standard Welch T-Test. All plots and graphs were also made with R. 

## Â F. Results
After being left with only hugh quality data, we were able to indeitify a significant distinction in testosterone levels between males and females, with the mean in the male group being 23.2 and in the female group 1.22. 
Additionally, we found a correlation between the performance difference in SD and LD, which is in line with our hyppothesis. 
WIth the data on the amygdala as well as on the hippocampus, we were able to identify a close correlation (0.74) between these two brain regions. This is to be expected, as they are both responsible for processing emotional memories.
