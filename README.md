# The Impact of Extraversion on Amygdala Activation During Long-Term Memory Retrieval: An fMRI Study

## Abstract
The relationship between personality traits and neural mechanisms underlying memory processing remains a crucial area of investigation in cognitive neuroscience. This study aims to examine whether extraversion predicts differences in amygdala activation during long-term memory tasks, while controlling for individual variations in memory performance. Using a sample of adult participants (N = [insert number]), we assessed extraversion through a standardized personality inventory and measured amygdala activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a series of long-term memory tasks. Linear regression analysis revealed that extraversion significantly predicted amygdala activation (p < 0.001), with higher levels of extraversion associated with greater activation during memory retrieval. Additionally, long-term memory performance was also a significant predictor of amygdala activation (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that personality traits, such as extraversion, may modulate the neural correlates of memory processing, particularly within the amygdala, which is known for its role in emotional memory. The results highlight the importance of considering individual differences in personality when examining the neural mechanisms of memory, providing new insights into how extraversion influences cognitive processes. Future research could explore whether these relationships hold across different types of memory tasks and in different populations.

## d. Introduction

Personality traits play a pivotal role in shaping cognitive processes, influencing how individuals perceive, encode, and retrieve information. One such trait, extraversion, has been extensively studied in relation to behavior, emotion, and cognitive performance. Extraversion is characterized by sociability, assertiveness, and a tendency to seek out stimulating environments, but its influence on memory processes remains an emerging area of research. While prior studies have explored how extraversion affects emotional and social cognition, relatively little is known about its impact on neural mechanisms underlying memory, particularly in relation to long-term memory (LD).

Memory processing is intricately tied to specific brain regions, with the amygdala playing a key role in encoding and retrieving emotionally salient memories. The amygdala has also been shown to interact with the hippocampus, a critical structure for memory consolidation, suggesting that emotional traits like extraversion may modulate memory-related brain activity. Research utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided valuable insights into how personality traits, including extraversion, influence brain activation in response to emotional stimuli. However, less is known about the extent to which extraversion influences amygdala activation during tasks that involve long-term memory retrieval.

Given that extraversion is associated with heightened emotional and social engagement, it is plausible that extraverts may exhibit increased amygdala activation when engaging in memory tasks, particularly those that involve emotionally charged or personally relevant information. Understanding this relationship can provide important insights into how personality shapes cognitive and emotional functioning at the neural level, with broader implications for fields such as psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and mental health research.

The current study aims to address this gap by investigating whether extraversion predicts differences in amygdala activation during long-term memory tasks. Specifically, we hypothesize that higher levels of extraversion will be associated with increased amygdala activation during the retrieval of long-term memories. Additionally, we control for long-term memory performance (LD) to ensure that any observed effects are not solely driven by memory ability itself. By examining these relationships, we seek to enhance our understanding of how personality traits such as extraversion interact with the brain’s memory systems, offering new insights into the neural basis of individual differences in cognitive proce

## E. Methods
### Participants 
A total of N = 1000 participants of an ongoing study were included. This large-scale and ongoing study serves to address several scientific questions, including questions in the field of imaging genetics, where several papers on the dataset have been previously published. The ethics committee of the Canton of Basel, Switzerland, approved the study protocol.
### Episodic memory task 
We used a picture free recall task to assess episodic memory. For picture encoding, 72 pictures, divided into three valence groups (negative, neutral, and positive), as well as 24 scrambled pictures were presented during the MRI scans by using MR-compatible LCD goggles (VisualSystem, NordicNeuroLab). On the basis of normative valence scores, pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; [Lang et al., 2008]) were assigned to emotionally negative (2.3 ± 0.6), neutral (5.0 ± 0.3), and positive (7.6 ± 0.4) groups. Eight neutral pictures were selected from an in-house standardized picture set in order to equate the picture set for visual complexity and content (e.g. human presence). Examples of pictures are as follows: erotica, sports, and appealing animals for the positive valence; bodily injury, snake, and attack scenes for the negative valence; and finally, neutral faces, household objects, and buildings for the neutral condition. 
 
### Working memory task 
Subjects completed the 0- and 2-back version of the n-back task after picture encoding, and before the recall task. The task consists of 12 blocks (six 0-back, six 2-back), in which 14 test stimuli (letters) were presented. The 0-back condition required participants to respond to the occurrence of the letter ‘x’ in a sequence of letters (e.g., N – l – X – g) and served as a non-memory-guided control condition, measuring general attention, concentration, and reaction time. The 2-back condition required subjects to compare the currently presented letter with the penultimate letter to decide whether they are identical or not (e.g., S – f – s – g). This task requires online monitoring, updating, and manipulating remembered information. It is therefore assumed to involve key working memory-related processes. Performance was recorded as a number of correct responses (accuracy). Performance in the 0-back condition (mean accuracy) served as the phenotype reflecting attentional processes, and the difference in accuracy between the 2-back and the 0-back condition served as the phenotype reflecting working memory performance. 

### fMRI acquisition 
Measurements were performed on a Siemens Magnetom Verio 3T whole-body MR unit equipped with a twelve-channel head coil. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image was acquired with a magnetization prepared gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE, TR = 2000 ms; TE = 3.37 ms; TI = 1,000 ms; flip angle=8; 176 sagittal slices; FOV = 256 mm; voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm3). Diffusion volumes were acquired by using a single-shot echo-planar sequence, and consisted of 64 diffusion-weighted volumes (b = 900 s/mm2) and one unweighted volume (b = 0). Acquisition parameters were as follows: TR=9,000ms, TE=82ms, FOV=320mm, GRAPPA R=2.0, voxel size 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5 mm3. 

### Statistical analysis 
Before using the data for our statistical analysis, quality checks were ensured, which left us with 833 particpants eligible for our study. All of the next statistical steps were also done on a replication sample to ensure robustness in the results. Measures for reliability, validation and aggregation were taken before conducting the main statistical analysis. The analysis on an association between extraversion and long-term memory performance on amygdala activation was determined by a linear regression model.


##  F. Results
After being left with only high quality data, we were able to indeitify a significant distinction in testosterone levels between males and females, with the mean in the male group being 23.2 and in the female group 1.22. Additionally, we found a significant correlation between the performance difference in SD and LD, which is to be expected. WIth the data on the amygdala as well as on the hippocampus, we were able to identify a close correlation (0.74) between these two brain regions. Since they are both responsible for processing emotional memories, a strong correlation was expected. Lastly, episodic memory performance as well as extraversion were strongly associated with amygdala activation (extraversion: p-value = 0, EM_LD: p-value = 0), which is in line with our hypothesis and further corroborates the existing research. 

## G. Discussion
The findings of this study provide compelling evidence that extraversion significantly predicts differences in amygdala activation during long-term memory retrieval. As hypothesized, individuals with higher levels of extraversion exhibited greater activation in the amygdala, even after controlling for long-term memory performance. These results align with existing research suggesting that extraversion is linked to heightened sensitivity to emotionally salient stimuli, and they extend this understanding to the domain of memory retrieval, particularly within the neural architecture supporting emotional memory processing.

Our results demonstrate that extraversion is a robust predictor of amygdala activation during long-term memory tasks, which adds to a growing body of literature that highlights the connection between personality traits and brain function. Previous studies have shown that extraversion is associated with increased amygdala activity in response to emotional and social stimuli, which may be explained by the amygdala’s role in processing emotional information. The current study extends these findings by showing that this relationship persists during memory retrieval tasks, suggesting that extraverts may engage emotional memory networks more strongly than introverts when recalling information, potentially because of the way they encode and store emotionally charged or socially relevant memories.

In addition to extraversion, long-term memory performance (LD) was also a significant predictor of amygdala activation. This is consistent with prior research showing that the amygdala and hippocampus are key regions involved in the consolidation and retrieval of emotionally salient memories. Our results indicate that individuals with better long-term memory performance exhibit stronger activation in the amygdala, supporting the idea that the amygdala not only processes emotions but also plays an integral role in supporting memory retrieval processes, particularly for emotionally-laden memories.

These findings have important implications for understanding the interaction between personality and neural mechanisms of memory. The fact that extraversion predicts amygdala activation during memory retrieval highlights the possibility that personality traits influence the neural circuitry involved in cognitive tasks beyond emotional or social stimuli. This suggests that extraversion may shape how the brain prioritizes and processes information, particularly in contexts where memory retrieval engages emotionally significant content. This is consistent with theories suggesting that personality traits modulate cognitive functioning by influencing attentional, perceptual, and motivational systems, and our results provide empirical support for these theoretical models in the domain of memory processing.

From a practical perspective, the observed relationship between extraversion and amygdala activation may have implications for mental health interventions and personalized approaches to cognitive training. Since the amygdala is involved in emotional regulation and memory processes, individuals with high extraversion may benefit from tailored strategies that leverage their increased neural engagement with emotionally relevant material. Additionally, understanding the neural correlates of personality traits like extraversion could help inform treatments for memory-related conditions, such as anxiety or depression, where amygdala dysregulation is often implicated.

While the present study contributes valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future research should aim to replicate these results in larger, more diverse populations to confirm the robustness of the relationships observed. Second, the study focused specifically on long-term memory tasks, but it would be beneficial to explore whether similar patterns of amygdala activation are evident during short-term memory or other cognitive processes. Additionally, while fMRI provides useful information about brain activity, it does not capture the temporal dynamics of memory processes. Complementary techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG), could provide further insights into how extraversion affects the timing and coordination of memory-related neural processes.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that extraversion significantly predicts amygdala activation during long-term memory retrieval, suggesting that personality traits influence not only social and emotional behaviors but also neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences in personality when studying memory and provide new avenues for research on the interaction between personality and brain function. Future studies should continue to explore the complex relationships between personality, memory, and brain activity, with the potential to deepen our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of individual differences in human behavior.
